  <h2>Changes to the Standard Terms</h2>
</header>

<section>
  <p>
    <strong>Publicity Rights</strong>: Modifying Section 14.7 of the Standard
    Terms, Provider may identify Customer and use Customer’s logo and trademarks
    on Provider’s website and in marketing materials to identify Customer as a
    user of the Product. Customer hereby grants Provider a non-exclusive,
    royalty-free license to do so in connection with any marketing, promotion,
    or advertising of Provider or the Product during the length of the
    Agreement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add as Section 1.8: “Usage Data and Customer Content may be used to develop,
    train, or enhance artificial intelligence or machine learning models that
    are part of Provider’s products and services, including third-party
    components of the Product, and Customer authorizes Provider to process its
    Usage Data and Customer Content for such purposes. However, (a) Usage Data
    and Customer Content must be aggregated before it can be used for these
    purposes, and (b) Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts
    consistent with industry standard technology to de-identify Usage Data and
    Customer Content before such use. Nothing in this section will reduce or
    limit Provider’s obligations regarding Personal Data that may be contained
    in Usage Data or Customer Content under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Due
    to the nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning, information
    generated by these features may be incorrect or inaccurate. Product features
    that include artificial intelligence or machine learning models are not
    human and are not a substitute for human oversight.” Add at the end of
    Section 5.2: “If Customer does not pay undisputed fees within the Payment
    Period, Customer will pay interest on the overdue amounts at the rate of
    1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Laws, whichever
    is less. In addition, Customer will reimburse Provider for all costs of
    collection (including attorneys’ fees).”
