    <h2>Terms of Service (<a href="https://vapi.ai/terms-of-service/">https://vapi.ai/terms-of-service/</a>)</h2>
	<p><strong>Last Updated: February 27, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service (these <strong>"Terms"</strong>) carefully, as they constitute a legally binding agreement
        between Superpowered Labs Inc., a Delaware corporation (<strong>"VAPI,"</strong> <strong>"we,"</strong> <strong>"us"</strong> or <strong>"our"</strong>) and an end-user and any
        employees, agents, contractors and any other entity on whose behalf the
        end-user accepts these terms (collectively, <strong>"you"</strong>
        and <strong>"your"</strong>) and apply to your use of our website and
        Services (as defined below). In case you are utilizing the Services as
        a representative of a party (e.g. your employer or customer,
        collectively the <strong>"Client"</strong>), your acceptance of these
        Terms also binds the Client.</p>

    <p><strong>This is a binding agreement</strong>. If you use the Services or click accept
        or agree to these Terms if presented to you in a user interface for the
        Services, or you have signed a subscription agreement that serves as a
        master agreement, you are legally bound by the obligations in these
        Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a Client, you
        represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Client to
        these Terms, and any reference to "you" and "your" will
        refer and apply to that party. If you do not agree to all of these
        Terms, you shall not use the Service and you should not set up an
        Account (as defined).</p>

    <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you expressly agree that except for limited
        circumstances, the parties will only resolve disputes by arbitration,
        solely on an individual basis.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of these Terms</h2>

    <p>You hereby agree to accept these Terms by opening an account under a
        username, notwithstanding any existing services agreement to which you
        may also be signatory which incorporated these Terms by reference.</p>

    <p>You also agree to abide by other VAPI rules and policies, including
        our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> (which explains what
        information we collect from you and how we protect it) that are
        expressly incorporated into and are a part of these Terms. Please read
        them carefully.</p>

    <p>Once you accept these Terms you are bound by them until they are
        terminated. See Section 7 (Term and Termination).</p>

    <h2>2. Using the Services</h2>

    <p><span class="underline">a. Right to Use and License</span>. Subject to your
        compliance with these Terms, VAPI hereby grants you a non-exclusive,
        non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and revocable (i) right
        to use the Services and (ii) where applicable in cases of on premise installations, license to
        object code that is installed in your Systems
        (where "Systems" means computing machine running code,
        whether on your premise or on a 3<sup>rd</sup> party's cloud platform), solely
        for the purposes of utilizing the Service to deploy AI voice agents and solely in the manner described in these
        Terms and in any technical documentation contained in, or provided with,
        the Services.</p>

    <p class="indent">You acknowledge and agree that you are only being granted a right to
        use the Services and nothing is being sold to you. You do not acquire
        any ownership interest in the Services under these Terms, or any other
        rights thereto, other than to use the
        Service in accordance with the use
        rights specified and other terms, conditions, and restrictions of
        these Terms. We reserve all other rights that are not granted in these
        Terms.</p>

    <p class="indent">See Section 4 for more details on your use and Intellectual Property
        Rights (as defined) under these Terms.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">b. What We Provide</span>. The Services include but
        are not limited to a hosted software solution
        (<strong>"Platform"</strong>) that allows you to create voice agents
        that can interact with your customers and stakeholders and respond to
        queries by such individuals in the most realistic manner possible.</p>

    <p class="indent">Our Platform (think of it as an orchestration layer over three modules
        that are provided by various suppliers as well as a collection of
        tools, including a web dashboard (<strong>"Dashboard"</strong>)), that allows you to, either via our API or via the
        Dashboard, utilize a <strong>transcribing
            service module</strong> and intake or record stakeholder speech (usually on your
        device), followed by the transcription of the speech to text (either on your
        device or in a cloud server), and then the <strong>processing of the text on a trained large
            language model</strong> (<strong>"LLM"</strong> or <strong>"AI Model"</strong>) to generate responses,
        and then the <strong>conversion of text to
            speech</strong> to be delivered to the stakeholder (using the voice module)
        (the Platform and additional value adds, such as phone numbers that
        connect to our Platform, but excluding Providers'
        offering, collectively, the <strong>"Services"</strong>).</p>

    <p class="indent">Our Platform stitches together the various modules' individual steps
        to provide a smooth and responsive conversation, which is notable not only for being
        latency-optimized, but also for being realistic, as our custom models create
        a conversational experience that feels human,
        utilizing tools with respect to managing endpointing,
        interruptions, filtering of background noise and voice, and more. For
        more details see <a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/how-vapi-works"><strong>How Vapi
                Works</strong></a> on our website.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">c. Third-Parties</span>. Our control layer
        interacts with our third-party service providers
        (our <strong>"Providers"</strong>) as part of Services or parties that
        you wish to utilize. We expect our Providers list to grow with time. You
        understand and agree that when you use the
        various aspects of the Services (i.e. the transcription (i.e. through
        providers such as Deepgram), the LLM processing (we support any
        OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including Azure OpenAI, or your own custom
        LLM) and our voice generation (all voice providers are
        supported)), we will be sharing Your
        Content (as defined) with each Provider, subject to each Provider's
        individual terms and conditions. We do not make any representation and
        warranties on any Provider's behalf, nor are we an agent of any such
        Provider. We principally provide you a control layer to obtain the best
        experience possible for AI-enabled voice agents using each such Provider's
        capabilities.</p>

    <p class="indent">Our Services are very flexible and our Platform allows you to
        conveniently customize which third parties you would like to use as
        part of the Services (whether our Providers or your own, including
        your own AI Models). If you have existing accounts with any of our
        Providers, you can bring your own API keys to Vapi. You can add them
        in the Dashboard under the Provider Keys tab. Once your API key is
        validated, you won't be charged when using that provider through Vapi.
        Instead, you'll be charged directly by the provider. The fees we
        charge you bundles in the usage fee from each of our Providers on a
        per use basis and our fee will be modified accordingly. Enterprise
        customers shall be subject to custom pricing schemes. For more details
        on customization and other details on our Service, check out our
        collection of <a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/introduction"><strong>Documents</strong></a> which
        will assist you in leveraging our Services efficiently.</p>

    <p class="indent">You will in certain instances, need to have separate subscriptions
        with our Providers. For instance, if you would like to utilize the
        benefits of certain voice generation module providers
        (i.e. ElevenLabs or PlayHT) you will need to subscribe to an API plan
        that suits your needs with the respective Provider, as further
        described in out documentation on our website.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">d. Use Restrictions.</span> You agree to not,
        directly or indirectly (and will not permit any third party) to:</p>

            linked to the Service;</li>
        <li>try to detect, scan, or test any
            vulnerabilities of the Services or any of our or our

            machine modeling, or developing templates or products for
            third-party.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="indent">In all cases, VAPI will determine in our sole discretion whether any
        action of an end-user violates the above rules. Violation of the
        above rules is a breach of these Terms.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">e. Service Updates</span>. You understand that the
        Services will evolve from time to time. You acknowledge and agree that
        VAPI may update the Services on the Platform with or without notifying

        software that you have installed on your System as applicable.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">f. Fees</span>. Usage of our Services is subject
        to the fees that are set out on our website. The fees you pay will be
        directly correlated with the amount of voice minutes processed through
        VAPI volume transmitted to our Platform.</p>

    <p class="indent">Nothing prevents us from revising the monthly fees charged for
        our Services, or introducing new features and benefits and charging
        additional amounts. Your costs under any subscription to our Services
        will not change until your then current term of subscription (e.g. if
        you are a monthly subscriber, then at the end of the month we revise
        our fees).</p>

    <p class="indent">Our fees are separate and apart from the fees our Providers
        charge or those third parties that you may have subscribed to yourself.
        For more detailed examples of fee scenarios, see our website
        for billing <a href="https://docs.vapi.ai/billing/examples"><strong>guidance</strong></a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights, Ownership and Grants</h2>

    <p><span class="underline">a. Your Content.</span> When you utilize our
        Service, all materials uploaded to or transmitted via the Platform is
        your content (<strong>"Your Content"</strong>). You own all rights and
        title in Your Content, including any Intellectual Property Rights (as
        defined). VAPI does not claim any ownership of Your Content or assert
        any rights under your Intellectual Property Rights other than as granted
        under these Terms.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">b. Rights You Grant Us</span>.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You hereby grant VAPI a worldwide, royalty-free,
            sublicensable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce,
            modify, adapt, edit, analyze, transmit, and distribute
            (<strong>"Handle"</strong>) Your Content during the Term. This license
            to Handle is solely for the purpose of us and our Providers providing
            you the Services.<br><br>

            The specific information you permit us to Handle is determined by
            customizable settings that are in your control.<br><br>

            Our API has a "hipaaEnabled" option, that limits VAPI's use of data
            if set to the "True" setting. If set to "True", data persistence
            (which refers to the ability of data to survive after the call is made
            to the Platform is completed) is disabled, VAPI would only has access
            to data inserted into the Platform via the Dashboard / API until
            deleted as per retention policy or manually by you and no call logs,
            recordings, or transcriptions are stored by us during or after your
            call. No information may be utilized for training our AI model.<br><br>

            Alternatively, if "hipaaEnabled" option set to "False", call data
            persistence is enabled, and we would have access to all audio data,
            transcripts, and data injected into the Platform via the Dashboard /
            API until deleted as per retention policy or manually by you. In this
            case, you grant us a right to use persisted call data on model
            training for either VAPI proprietary model or on-premise hosted models
            for call improvement features, including but not limited to
            end-of-turn and interruption detection.<br><br>

            We do not utilize Your Content to obtain any customer specific
            intelligence. Our scope of use of data in all instances is only for
            purposes of enhancing call features, latency and the performance of
            your AI voice agents, and does not in any way relate to capturing and
            using personal information of any caller or any information/inputs of
            a caller in respect of your business or the caller.</li>

        <li>You agree that submission of any ideas, suggestions,
            documents, and/or proposals to VAPI (<strong>"Feedback"</strong>) is
            at your own risk and that VAPI has no obligations (including without
            limitation obligations of confidentiality) with respect to such
            Feedback. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary
            to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to VAPI a fully paid,
            royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and
            fully sublicensable and transferable right and license to use,
            reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format,
            create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or
            non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Feedback for any
            purpose.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="underline">c. VAPI's Rights</span>. The Services
        utilize technology and capabilities and
        contain certain materials provided by us as well as our licensors,
        including but not limited to, all proprietary LLM, content, information,

        use rights, as set out under Section 2 above are subject to compliance
        with these Terms and as applicable payment of the applicable fees.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">d. Rights Granted to Third Parties</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Providers that deliver part of our Services, whether pursuant to a
        contract directly with you or though us, require rights to Handle Your
        Content as applicable to the service they provide. Each Provider has
        its own contractual terms that apply. Please review the specific
        terms of service or equivalent agreement which apply to the Provider
        that you elect to utilize in respect of each of the Service module for
        transcription, LLM, and voice generation. While we expect each
        Provider to comport to industry norms and comply with their privacy
        policies and the license and rights granted to them under terms agreed
        upon with you, we do not monitor nor make any guarantees or warranties
        in respect of their compliance with their contractual and legal
        obligations.</p>

    <h2>5. Aggregate Stats</h2>

    <p>VAPI shall monitor your use of the

    <p><span class="underline">a. Term.</span> These Terms commence on the earlier
        of the date you first opened an Account to use the Services or the date
        when you accepted these Terms, and these Terms will remain in full force
        and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in
        accordance with this Section.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">b. Termination by VAPI.</span> If you have breached
        any provision of these Terms, if VAPI is required to do so by law (e.g.,
        where the provision of the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), or if it
        is commercially impracticable for VAPI to provide the Services, VAPI has
        the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any
        of the Services provided to you.</p>

    <p class="indent">You agree that all terminations will be made in VAPI's sole discretion and that VAPI will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account, provided that if applicable, VAPI shall refund you any prepaid amount, on a pro-rata basis, for any duration of the term of subscription to our Service which remains after the termination of your Account.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">d. Termination by You.</span> Other than the
        clauses which survive any expiry or termination of these Terms, these
        Terms (with surviving terms excepted) shall not apply to you upon your notice to us requesting Services
        no longer be provided.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">e. Effect of Termination.</span> If Services are
        terminated for any reason, your use rights shall cease and you may not
        be able to access your Account and all related information or files
        associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof) may be
        deleted. VAPI will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any
        suspension or termination.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">f. Survival</span>. The following Sections shall
        survive any termination of your use right: This Section 7(f), Sections
        4(a), 4(b)(ii), 4(c), 4(d), 7(e), 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>

    <p>These Terms are subject to occasional revision by VAPI. When changes are
        made, VAPI will make a new copy of these Terms of Service available on
        the website and within the App. We will also update the date at the top
        of these Terms. If we make any substantial changes, and you have
        registered with us to create an Account, we will also send an email to
        you at the last e-mail address you provided to us to notify you. Any
        changes to these Terms will be effective immediately for new registered
        users of the Services and will be effective 30 days after posting notice
        of such changes on the website for existing registered users, provided
        that any material changes will be effective for registered users who
        have an Account with us upon the earlier of 30 days after posting notice
        of such changes on the website or 30 days after dispatch of an e-mail
        notice of such changes to registered users. VAPI may require you to
        provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before
        further use of the Services is permitted. <span class="uppercase">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY
            CHANGES AFTER RECEIVING A NOTICE OF SUCH CHANGE(S), YOU WILL STOP USING
            THE SERVICES. OTHERWISE, YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES
            YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGES</span>.</p>

    <h2>9. Indemnity</h2>

    <p><span class="underline">a. Your Indemnification Obligation</span>. You
        agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold
        harmless VAPI, our directors, officers, stockholders, employees,
        licensors, providers, and agents
        (<strong>"VAPI Parties"</strong>) from and against any and all claims, demands,
        losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including
        reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, "Losses") due to,
        arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use
        of the Services; (b) your breach of these Terms, any rights of another
        party, or any applicable law or
        regulation, including but not limited to the Telephone Consumer
        Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud
        and Abuse Prevention Act, and their implementing
        regulations; or (c) your negligence or
        willful misconduct. VAPI reserves the right, at its own cost, to
        assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
        subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully
        cooperate with VAPI in asserting any available defenses. <span class="underline">You agree
            that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of
            your Account, these Terms and/or your access to the
            Services.</span></p>

    <p><span class="underline">b. Indemnification by VAPI.</span> VAPI will
        defend, indemnify and hold harmless each you and as applicable your
        officers, directors, employees, contractors and licensors
        (collectively, <strong>"Subscriber Indemnitees"</strong>), from and against any
        costs, damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are awarded
        in final judgment against or paid in settlement in connection with any
        action or suit brought against a Subscriber Indemnitee by a third
        party based upon a third-party claim that (i) the Services, as
        provided by VAPI pursuant to these Terms (exclusive of any Your
        Content), infringe any Intellectual Property Rights or misappropriate
        any trade secret, or (ii) arises from or relate to the gross
        negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or more culpable acts or
        omissions of VAPI, violation of applicable law by VAPI, or any breach
        by VAPI of any of its representations or warranties hereunder.
        Subscriber Indemnitees agree to provide VAPI reasonable cooperation,
        at VAPI's expense, in the defense and settlement of such claim, and
        VAPI shall have sole authority to defend or settle such claim,
        provided (y) no settlement shall require payment or a confession or
        admission of fault by any Subscriber Indemnitees or require any
        Subscriber Indemnitee to take (or refrain from taking) any action
        without the applicable Subscriber Indemnitee's prior written consent
        and (z) if such claim relates to any Intellectual Property Rights or
        Confidential Information of the Subscriber Indemnitees, the Subscriber
        Indemnitees shall have sole control of the defense and settlement of
        such claim.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">c. Injunctions</span>. If your use of the Services
        is, or in VAPI's reasonable opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to
        claims specified in Section 9(b), then VAPI may at its sole option and
        expense (without limiting VAPI's indemnity obligation to Subscriber
        Indemnitees): (a) replace or modify the Services to make them
        non-infringing and of substantially equivalent functionality;
        (b) procure for you the right to continue using the Services under
        these Terms; or (c) terminate your rights and VAPI's obligation under
        these Terms with respect to Services and refund to you a pro-rata
        portion of the fees paid in advance by you in respect of the Services.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">d. Exclusions</span>. Notwithstanding the terms of
        Sections 9(b) (Indemnification by VAPI) and 9(c)
        (Injunctions), VAPI will have no liability for any infringement or
        misappropriation claim of any kind to the extent that it results from:
        (a) any modification or alteration of the Services by Subscriber
        Indemnitee or existing employees, agents or contractors other than as
        permitted in these Terms, or any user's failure to reasonably
        safeguard login credentials, if such claim would not have occurred but
        for such modification or alteration, or (b) Subscriber's or a user's
        use of the Services other than as permitted in these Terms.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">e. Sole Remedy</span>. <span class="uppercase">THE FOREGOING STATES THE
            ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF VAPI AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
            PERMITTED CONTRACTORS, AND LICENSORS WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT
            OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF SUCH THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</span></p>

    <p>a. You expressly understand and agree that, to the extent
        permitted by applicable law, your use of the Services is at your sole
        risk, and the Services are provided on an "as is"
        and "as available" basis, with all faults. VAPI expressly
        disclaims all warranties, representations, and conditions of any kind,

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p><span class="underline">a. Disclaimer of Certain Damages</span>. TO THE
        FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL A PARTY BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR DATA, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR

    <p><span class="underline">b. Cap on Liability.</span> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY WILL NOT BE LIABLE BEYOND THE GREATER OF
        (i) $100 USD, (ii) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING
        THE DATE OF THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THESE LIMITATIONS AND
        EXCLUSIONS REGARDING DAMAGES APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE
        ADEQUATE COMPENSATION.</p>

    <p class="indent">SOME COUNTRIES, STATES, PROVINCES, OR
        OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES
        OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS STATED IN THIS SECTION, SO THE TERMS
        HEREIN MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p><span class="underline">a. Governing Law</span>. These Terms and all related
        orders and subscriptions related hereto, and all matters arising out of
        or relating to these Terms, are governed by, and construed in accordance
        with, the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the
        conflict of laws provisions thereof.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">b. Arbitration</span>. You and VAPI agree that any
        controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or relates to the
        Service, these Terms, or any additional terms, whether heretofore or
        hereafter arising (collectively, a <strong>"Dispute"</strong>) 
        arising out of will be resolved by
        binding arbitration, rather than in court, except for: (1) any
        controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or relates to our
        actual or alleged intellectual property rights; (2) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations
        of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; (3) any
        claim for equitable relief.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">c. Informal Dispute Resolution.</span> You and VAPI
        agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve disputes can result in
        a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and VAPI
        therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against
        the other (or initiates an action in small claims court (which you agree
        shall only be done in the city of San Francisco, California) if a party
        so elects), we will personally meet or confer telephonically or via
        videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any
        Dispute covered by this clause (<strong>"Informal Dispute
            Resolution Conference"</strong>). If you are represented by counsel, your
        counsel may participate in the conference at your cost, but you will
        also participate in the conference.</p>

    <p class="indent">The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in
        writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
        Conference (<strong>"Notice"</strong>), which will occur within 45
        days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension
        is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to VAPI that you intend
        to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent
        by email to support@vapi.ai. The Notice must include: (1) your name,
        telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your
        Account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing
        address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a
        description of your dispute. Your email must be followed up with a
        written mailed notice to our address at support@vapi.ai.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">d. Waiver of Jury Trial.</span> <span class="uppercase">YOU AND VAPI HEREBY
            WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
            TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.</span> You and VAPI are instead electing
        that all disputes will be resolved by arbitration under these Terms,
        except as set out under Section 12(b) above.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">e. Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized
            Relief.</span> <span class="uppercase">YOU AND VAPI AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN
            SECTION, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
            INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE
            BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE
            BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS,
            COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS.</span></p>

    <p><span class="underline">f. Rules and Forum.</span> These Terms evidence a
        transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other
        provision in these Terms with respect to the applicable substantive law,
        the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Section 12 and any arbitration
        proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above
        does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of
        your Notice, you and VAPI agree that either party will have the right to
        finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration
        will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
        (<strong>"AAA"</strong>), in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration
        Rules then in effect in the city of San Francisco, California, by one
        arbitrator alone and such arbitrator will have exclusive authority to
        resolve any dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out
        of or related to the interpretation or application of this Section 12,
        including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the
        arbitration requirement or any portion of this Section 12.</p>

    <h2>13. International Use</h2>

    <p>The Services can be accessed from countries around the world and may
        contain references to features and services that are not available in
        your country. VAPI makes no representations that the Services are
        appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or
        use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and
        are responsible for compliance with local laws. If you are using the Services and are not in the
        United States, you agree that the location for dispute resolution is
        acceptable to you and that you will not challenge the forum as being
        inconvenient for you.</p>

    <h2>14. Severability, Waiver</h2>

    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that
        provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Any waiver or failure to
        enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed
        a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other
        occasion.</p>

    <h2>15. Export Control</h2>

    <p>You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as
        authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you
        obtained the Services, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but
        without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a)
        into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S.
        Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.
        Department of Commerce's Denied Person's List or Entity List. By using
        the Services, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in
        a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been
        designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist
        supporting" country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government
        list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use the
        Services for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law. You acknowledge and
        agree that products, services or technology provided by VAPI are subject
        to the export control laws and regulations of the United States. You
        will comply with these laws and regulations and will not, without prior
        U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer VAPI
        products, services or technology, either directly or indirectly, to any
        country in violation of such laws and regulations.</p>

    <h2>16. Notice</h2>

    <p>All notices required or permitted under these Terms will be in writing,
        will reference these Terms, and will be deemed given: (i) when delivered
        personally; (ii) one business day after deposit with a nationally
        recognized express courier, with written confirmation of receipt; (iii)
        three business days after having been sent by registered or certified
        mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iv) when sent by
        email, on the date the email was sent if sent during normal business
        hours of the receiving party, and on the next business day if sent after
        normal business hours of the receiving party. In the event that the last
        e-mail address you provided to VAPI is not valid, or for any reason is
        not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by these
        Terms, VAPI's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will
        nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to VAPI at
        the following email address: support@vapi.ai</p>

    <h2>17. Assignment</h2>

    <p>These Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be
        assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you
        without VAPI's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment,
        subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will
        be null and void. VAPI may assign these Terms and any other right or
        obligation to a party without any consent or notification requirement to
        you.</p>

    <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>

    <p>VAPI will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting
        from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited
        to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or
        military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, strikes or
        shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or
        materials.</p>
